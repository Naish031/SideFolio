## Introduction

NextRep Sports is a gymwear e-commerce store I developed as my final year university project. This wasn’t just another online store — it was a platform designed to explore how artificial intelligence, specifically conversational assistants, could make product discovery smarter and more intuitive.

The goal? Build a modern, responsive, and AI-enhanced shopping experience that makes it easier for fitness enthusiasts to find the right products using natural language.

## Inspiration

The idea for this project came from two personal passions: tech and fitness. I'd long wanted to build an e-commerce store, and when the opportunity came to do a final year project, everything aligned. I chose the gymwear niche because I actively work out and understand the market. The AI chatbot assistant became the standout feature that made this more than a standard store.

## Objectives and Core Features

My primary aim was to:

- Build a fully functional e-commerce store with real product data
- Integrate a chatbot to improve product discovery
- Use Shopify as a CMS and storefront backend
- Create a smooth, animated, and responsive UI with Tailwind and Next.js
- Deploy the final product on Vercel

Key e-commerce features implemented:

- Product filtering by category and collection
- Cart system with add/remove/update actions
- Checkout process via Shopify
- Real-time updates using Shopify webhooks

## Chatbot Functionality

The chatbot is the heart of the NextRep Sports experience.

Two versions were developed:

1. **Keyword-based fallback** — If DeepSeek AI fails or takes too long, the system detects keywords from over 100+ common queries to suggest relevant products.
2. **AI-powered version** — DeepSeek AI connects via API to understand user input and recommend products using knowledge of all items in the store.

The chatbot sits fixed in the bottom-right corner and opens as a modal — designed to feel like a natural part of the browsing experience without disrupting the user’s flow.

## Design Approach

The UI/UX design for NextRep Sports was developed hands-on during frontend implementation rather than through formal wireframes. I drew inspiration from Gymshark and built the frontend directly with Tailwind CSS. Some of the key design choices included:

- Sticky navigation header with cart visibility
- Mobile-first layout for responsive experience
- Neutral background with bold, clean product imagery
- Clear typography for accessibility

## Tech Stack and Development Workflow

- **Frontend**: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **Backend**: Shopify Storefront API (GraphQL)
- **AI**: DeepSeek API integration with fallback logic
- **Deployment**: Vercel + GitHub CI/CD
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub (see Appendix – Figure A4 for commit history)

GraphQL played a significant role in powering backend operations:

- `getProducts`, `getCollectionProducts` for product retrieval
- `addToCart`, `removeFromCart` for cart actions
- `createCart` and `checkout` flow integration
- `revalidate()` webhook to keep content fresh

## Technical Challenges

Several roadblocks came up during development:

- **Bulk CSV imports** into Shopify were tricky due to strict formatting and rejected image URLs. After testing, I used Shopify’s sample template and carefully validated image links and required fields.
- **GraphQL schema learning curve**: Shopify’s nested GraphQL structure required deep trial-and-error, especially when building dynamic filters and cart logic.

## Reflections and Lessons Learned

Building NextRep Sports gave me hands-on experience with full-stack web development, combining frontend animation, real-time data updates, third-party API integration, and conversational AI.

It also taught me the importance of building systems that fail gracefully (e.g., chatbot fallback), designing with responsiveness in mind, and staying organized through consistent Git workflows.

## Conclusion

NextRep Sports is more than just a final year project — it’s a real-world digital product built with modern tech and practical problem-solving. It reflects both my passion for fitness and my ability to create full-stack web apps that are performant, engaging, and user-focused.
